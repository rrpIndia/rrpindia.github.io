<ol><li>Taking Kashmir issue to UNO</li>
<li>there was no need for Indus Water Trearty. Take all water, and give whatever they pay, subject to good behavior. Yet Jawaharlal Ghazi signed it in 1960</li>
<li>Wakf act 1954 gives previleges to Wakf more than normal trust. eg if land owned by any private entity or person X is occupied by someone Y for over 14 years, and Y has papers proving his possession and X makes no claim over it, then X loses rights and it becomes property of Y. But Wakf act 1954 makes this inapplicable on land claimed by Wakf</li>
<li>Likewise, property left by Muslims who migrated to pakistan between 1946 - 1948 was made Wakf property</li></ol>

        <h1>Every historian is a paid historian</h1>
        <p> <q>Every Historian is a paid historian , every economist is a paid
                economist
                (jun-20-2012)</q> <br>

            Just as every journalist is a paid journalist, every historian is a
            paid
            historian and every economist is a paid-economist. At least, the
            historians and
            economists who have written textbooks in India are all paid
            historians and paid
            economists. Paid by who? Paid how? And are all of them paid ones?
            Not even a
            few of them are unpaid? And how to reduce this mess?<br>

            Historians hid the reason why British mixed cow tallow and pig
            tallow in
            bullets in 1850s <br>
            In around 1982, in 8th class, I first read about 1857 revolution. I
            read that
            Indian soldiers rebelled against British, and one principle reason
            was that
            British were using cow tallow (tallow = animal fat = charbi) and
            pig tallow in
            the Enfield Rifle&apos;s bullets. The bullet back then used to have
            a
            cap which
            first needs to be removed. The cap of the bullet had to be removed
            using teeth,
            because one hand is holding the rifle and another hand is holding
            the bullet.
            So a few drops of tallow used in the bullet will go in the
            soldier&apos;s mouth. For
            Hindu soldiers, drops of cow tallow going in their mouth was
            against their
            religion. And for muslim soldiers, drops of pig tallow going in
            their mouth was
            against their religion. And so they rebelled. That&apos;s what textbook
            writer
            eminent historian Romilla Thapar said in the textbook. The
            impression Romilla
            Thapar created was “see, few drops of tallow, and soldiers went in
            rebellion
            --- how backward, how primitive, how irrational were these Indian
            soldiers”.
            The textbook portrayed Indian soldiers as superstitious, backward
            minded and
            irrational. And that&apos;s exactly what history teacher also said –
            that Indian
            soldiers back then were very superstitious. . I now wonder, if such
            statement
            was part of her B Ed in History.

            So I asked the history teacher -- "Lets say soldiers were all
            backward minded.
            But why did East India company use pig tallow and cow tallow? Why
            EIC did NOT
            use buffalo tallow? After all they wanted to rule and do business.
            So why don&apos;t
            make a small change to suit soldiers?”. My history teacher laughed
            and said
            "well, the British did not have a Gujju brain like you have" , and
            whole class
            had a laugh ... so did I , and question got dispersed for the
            time-being. But
            the question remained in my mind for years and years. Why not use
            buffalo
            tallow? The British were surely intelligent --- otherwise they
            would not have
            been able to travel half the world and defeat Indian kings. Why
            didn&apos;t this
            simple solution occurred to British that they should use buffalo
            tallow? So the
            answer I thought in back in 1980s was – “British were perhaps not
            knowing Hindu
            and Muslim customs. So they used unknowingly used cow tallow and
            pig tallow,
            and wham-bam … Indian soldiers went on rebellion.”. But that answer
            made no
            sense to me. Why didn&apos;t soldiers ask their general to use buffalo
            tallow before
            rebelling? And how come British didn&apos;t know Indian customs? For
            years, I could
            not come up with any satisfactory answer.

            Some 13 years later, in 1995, I found the answer, that the British
            had used pig
            and cow tallow to induce caste-debarring (i.e. jaati-nikaalaa) of
            Indian
            soldiers from their caste\community, so that converting Indian
            soldiers to
            Christianity becomes easier !!!

            Let me elaborate. If a soldier is forced or manipulated to use
            bullets with cow
            tallow and pig tallow, and drops of cow tallow or pig tallow will
            go in his
            mouth. And then he will be excommunicated =. jaat-bahar =
            naat-bahar i.e.
            people of his community and religion will expel the soldier. Now a
            person often
            needs spiritual solace and if he cant go to his mosque or temple,
            he will
            become easy audience for the Missionary serving in EIC. And it will
            become easy
            to convert him.

            Later, I also found that EIC barracks did not have temples and
            mosques, but
            always had church. And soldiers were forced to attend church, till
            they flatly
            refused and threatened to leave EIC army. And soldiers were also
            not permitted
            to keep Hindu or Muslim symbols and pictures, but allowed to keep
            Christian
            symbols and pictures. The few soldiers who converted got better
            promotions.
            Essentially,. EIC was using 10s of tricks, incentives and force to
            impose
            Christianity. The soldiers had rebelled against sum total of all
            those tricks,
            incentives and force, not just tallow alone, as (paid?) historians
            wrote in the
            textbooks.

            (Aside : One of my later posts will explain why EIC did not use cow
            tallow for
            bullets given to Sikh soldiers !! And they did not use pig tallow
            in bullets
            meant for Pathan soldiers of present day North West Pakistan area
            !! Those
            bullets all had buffalo tallow. Apparently, EIC did not want to
            displease all
            at the same time. )

            So why would EIC want to convert Indian soldiers? The (paid?)
            historians and
            (paid?) economists all tell us that EIC came only for business and
            started
            ruling for protecting business, but had no interest in spreading
            religion.. So
            the (paid?) historians and (paid?) economist all tell us that EIC
            never
            promoted conversions. But EIC did promote conversions thru and
            thru. Why?

            Because if a soldier gets detached from local religion and
            community, he can be
            more effectively used to suppress the locals. Also, EIC wanted to
            convince its
            own British soldiers that EIC is serious about spreading
            Christianity, so that
            religious minded soldiers get an additional motivation. There are
            10s of
            factors why spreading Christianity was profitable to EIC and is
            also profitable
            to existing MNCs and US Military. I will discuss this in a separate
            post. But
            anyway, it was clear that EIC was before using buffalo tallow and
            later it
            started using cow tallow and pig tallow so that soldiers get
            excommunicated and
            it becomes easy to convert.

            So next question that came to my mind was – why did historians such
            as Romilla
            Thapar did not write that in my 8th class history textbook?

            This didn&apos;t occur to them? It was too obvious to miss. It took me
            15 years to
            guess, because I was not spending 8 hours a day on history and did
            not have
            access to many original records which they had. They simply had too
            much
            information with them. They could not have missed the fact that use
            of cow
            tallow and pig tallow was intentional and had a purpose.

            So why didn&apos;t Romilla Thapar and other historians wrote in the
            textbook that
            EIC wanted to spread Christianity and with that purpose, EIC used
            cow tallow
            and pig tallow?

            So in around 1995, I started suspecting that historians were paid
            not to write
            about the motives of EIC. But explanation needed some detailing.
            After all, EIC
            owners were all dead long back and they could not have paid
            historians. Also,
            if anyone paid, how exactly did they pay? Did they pay Rs X per
            fact they would
            hide? And what is historians tell truth after taking Rs X.

            After long fact gathering, I concluded that following was the
            mechanism used to
            “pay” historians

            The British had significant control over India even after they
            left. Major
            industrial houses such as Tata, Birla, Sarabhai, Bajaj etc depended
            on British
            for spare parts of the machines. Not giving them spare parts would
            have meant
            end of their factories. Some media houses were still under control
            of British.
            And may be, British had information, pictures or other material
            which using
            which blackmail of Indian leaders would have been possible.
            Further, if Subhash
            Chandra Bose was alive and in British or Russian custody, then
            British could
            have blackmailed Jawaharlal Ghazi by telling “obey us, or else we
            will send
            Subhash Chandra Bose to India ; then he will become PM, and you
            will be
            nowhere”. IOW, British had many levers over Indian industrialists
            and
            Jawaharlal Ghazi to control them.

            So under British pressure, Jawaharlal Ghazi told elite historians
            to write
            history that would hide intentions of EIC in spreading Christianity
            in India
            and keep Indians in dark about intentions of British to impose
            Christianity in
            India.

            The way Jawaharlal Ghazi told elite historians is “see, if you
            historians write
            pro-British or less anti-British history, you will get promotions,
            foreign
            trips etc and if you write too much anti-British history, then you
            may even be
            expelled and harassed”.

            Also, the History bodies in UK\USA could have promised good
            ratings, foreign
            trips, allowances, project grants etc if historians were to hide
            reasons by
            using cow and pig tallow, and not give any funding etc if
            historians tell
            students on motives of EIC in using cow/ping tallow. Back in 1950s
            till .1990s,
            foreign trip was a big incentive.

            So some historians such as Romilla Thapar sold out and got
            promoted, and those
            who did sell out not got kicked out and their works did not reach
            textbooks.
            And the “successful” historians. deleted the facts that EIC had pig
            tallow and
            cow tallow for conversion purpose.

            And thus, 8th class history textbook did not have the line that
            “British had
            used pig tallow and cow tallow to impose Christianity on Indian
            soldiers”.

            IOW, these historians were “paid historians”, just as we have “paid
            journalists”, “paid editors”, paid judges” etc. The payments these
            historians
            got for hiding the truth were :

            Positions, fame
            Power to recruit people – translates into cash and many nefarious
            benefits
            Grants to write books
            tens of other grants running into crores of rupees
            Foreign tours
            To get positions/payments, the history textbook writers “tailor”
            the
            history-textbooks that would please those in-charge of deciding
            promotions and
            grants.

            The list of facts history textbook writers have been hiding and
            downplaying is
            long. One example is that all history textbooks in India refer to
            1946 Nary
            Revolt as Navy Mutiny. Mutiny is lowly and derogatory word, while
            Revolt is a
            respectable word. If it was a mere Mutiny and not a Revolt, then
            why did
            British got so scared and left? In any case, the British did not
            want word
            “Revolt” to be used for Navy Revolt and instead wanted it to be
            referred as
            Mutiny. And so all paid historian refer it as Navy Mutiny and not
            as Navy
            Revolt. Likewise, all history textbook writers in India refuse to
            write the
            fact that British started serious discussion on independence only
            after Navy
            Revolt in 1946, and ask students to compare and contrast importance
            of Congress
            and Mohanbhai vs contribution of Mahatma Subhashchandra Bose. The
            list of facts
            historians deliberately downplay or outrightly refuse to write is
            long, and
            will mention in some other article. But suffices to say that just
            like “all
            mediamen are paid news”. “all historians are paid historians”.

            =====================

            Solution to the problem of paid historians
            Broadly, I divide historians into two parts --- those who are 100%
            privately
            funded and those who thrive on substantially on Govt funds and Govt
            made laws
            and regulations. The Govt paid historians not get salaries and
            grants, but
            their work becomes part of textbooks, which students are required
            read,
            memorize and write in the exams and their textbooks&apos; printing is
            also
            subsidized by Govt. So while their salary and grants may be few
            lakhs, but the
            money spent in subsidizing their publication runs in crores and the
            fact that
            students are made/forced to read their writing ensures audience of
            crores and
            crores readers. With Govt support, getting such audience would have
            cost crores
            of rupees of marketing cost.

            Which Gazette Notification drafts will reduce the possibilities
            that Govt-paid
            historians do not sell out to private interests such as British or
            Ministers or
            anyone? The Gazette Notification drafts I propose is

            Divide Indian History Council into 5 independent Councils, with
            Right to Recall
            on each of its Chairman

            Let each State have its own History Council or two History Council
            with
            recallable Chairman

            The History Textbook Officer for each State will be recallable, and
            Central
            Govt will not have any textbook officer. The students in Central
            Board will
            study history books from the state in which they are and exams will
            be taken
            that by that State only

            Jury System over Staff in History Councils

            Grand Jury in History Council, and any Historians in History
            Council can
            publish an article with permission of Chairman or permission of
            Grand Jury in
            case Chairman denies permission.

            These steps will decrease the sell-outs in historians. How?

            If citizens come to know that a Chairman has deliberately hidden an
            important
            fact, then they will not spare him. The RTR procedures will ensure
            that
            Chairman do not dare to hide important facts that comes to notice.
            Further, an
            internal Grand Jury System and Jury System will ensure that if an
            employee in
            History Council is hell bent on exposing some facts, the Chairman
            will not be
            able to stop him. Further, competition between History Chairmen
            will reduce the
            benefits they may derive by hiding facts. Because a person-A who
            wants some
            historical facts to remain hidden will pay chairman-B1 who is
            in-charge of
            airing that fact, only if it is guaranteed that chairman -B2,
            chairman -B3,
            chairman-B4 and chairman-B5 will also hide those facts. For this,
            he will need
            to pay all chairmen. Further, the JurySys and Grand Jury System
            will create
            independence for all Historians in the council. So those who want
            to suppress
            facts will now need to pay too large number of individuals. In such
            large
            sample, there will be always a small number of individuals who
            refuse to sell
            out, and so the truth will make its way.

            So above GN will reduce the possibility of history being
            “paid-history”

            Why did economist hid information on regressiveness of taxes?
            In the next article, I will explain why economics textbook writers
            hid the
            information about regressiveness factor wrt taxation i.e. the
            economics
            textbook writers never even BA students that inheritance and wealth
            tax are
            less regressive than income tax, which is less regressive than
            sales tax or VAT
            or entertainment tax. The main reason was --- they were “paid” not
            to write
            about it. All this in next article on paid economists.

            Paid media sponsors (Rocofeller, Rothschild, Ambani, Adani, Jindal,
            Tata etc)
            are making money illegally from mineral loot every year is almost
            equal to the
            addition of money collected from all types of tax year round by
            central and

        At least, the historians and economists who have written textbooks in
        India are all paid historians and paid economists.<br />
        Paid by <strong>who?</strong> Paid <strong>how?</strong> And are all of
        them<strong> paid ones?</strong> Not

      <h2>
        Historians hid the reason why British mixed cow tallow and pig tallow
        in bullets in 1850s.
      </h2>
      <p>
        In around 1982, in 8th class, I first read about 1857 revolution. I
        read that Indian soldiers rebelled against British, and one principle
        reason was that British were using cow tallow (tallow = animal fat =
        charbi) and pig tallow in the Enfield Rifle&apos;s bullets. <br />
        The bullet back then used to have a cap which first needs to be
        removed. The cap of the bullet had to be removed using teeth, because
        one hand is holding the rifle and another hand is holding the bullet.
        So a few drops of tallow used in the bullet will go in the
        soldier&apos;s mouth. <br />
        For Hindu soldiers, drops of cow tallow going in their mouth was
        against their religion. And for muslim soldiers, drops of pig tallow
        going in their mouth was against their religion. And so they rebelled.
        <br />
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        That&apos;s what textbook writer eminent historian
        <em>Romilla Thapar</em> said in the textbook. The impression Romilla
        Thapar created was
        <em>
          “see, few drops of tallow, and soldiers went in rebellion --- how
          backward, how primitive, how irrational were these Indian
          soldiers”.</em
        >
        The textbook portrayed Indian soldiers as superstitious, backward
        minded and irrational.<br />
        And that&apos;s exactly what history teacher also said – that Indian
        soldiers back then were very superstitious. . I now wonder, if such
        statement was part of her B Ed in History. So I asked the history
        teacher -- "Lets say soldiers were all backward minded. But why did
        East India company use pig tallow and cow tallow? Why EIC did NOT use
        buffalo tallow? After all they wanted to rule and do business. So why
        don&apos;t make a small change to suit soldiers?”.<br />
        My history teacher laughed and said "well, the British did not have a
        Gujju brain like you have" , and whole class had a laugh ... so did I ,
        <br />
        and question got dispersed for the time-being.<br /><br />
        But the question remained in my mind for years and years.
        <strong>Why not use buffalo tallow?</strong> <br />
        The British were surely intelligent --- otherwise they would not have
        been able to travel half the world and defeat Indian kings. Why
        didn&apos;t this simple solution occurred to British that they should
        use buffalo tallow?<br />
        So the answer I thought in back in 1980s was – “British were perhaps
        not knowing Hindu and Muslim customs. So they used unknowingly used cow
        tallow and pig tallow, and wham-bam … Indian soldiers went on
        rebellion.”. But that answer made no sense to me.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Why didn&apos;t soldiers ask their general to use buffalo tallow
          before rebelling?
        </li>

        <li>And how come British didn&apos;t know Indian customs?</li>
      </ul>

      <hr />
      <p>
        For years, I could not come up with any satisfactory answer. Some 13
        years later, in 1995, I found the answer, that the British had
        <strong>used pig and cow tallow to induce caste-debarring</strong>
        (i.e. jaati-nikaalaa) of Indian soldiers from their caste\community, so
        that
        <strong>converting Indian soldiers to Christianity</strong> becomes
        easier !!!<br />
        Let me elaborate. If a soldier is forced or manipulated to use bullets
        with cow tallow and pig tallow, and drops of cow tallow or pig tallow
        will go in his mouth. And then he will be excommunicated =. jaat-bahar
        = naat-bahar i.e. people of his community and religion will expel the
        soldier.<br />
        Now a person often needs spiritual solace and if he cant go to his
        mosque or temple, he will become easy audience for the Missionary
        serving in EIC. And it will become easy to convert him.<br />
        Later, I also found that
        <em
          >EIC barracks did not have temples and mosques, but always had
          church</em
        >. And soldiers were forced to attend church, till they flatly refused
        and threatened to leave EIC army.<br />
        And soldiers were also
        <em>not permitted to keep Hindu or Muslim symbols and pictures</em>,
        but <em>allowed to keep Christian symbols and pictures</em>. The few
        soldiers who converted got better promotions.<br />
        Essentially,. EIC was using 10s of tricks, incentives and force to
        impose Christianity.
        <strong
          >The soldiers had rebelled against sum total of all those tricks,
          incentives and force, not just tallow alone</strong
        >, as (paid?) historians wrote in the textbooks. <br />
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Aside : One of my later posts will explain why EIC did not use cow
        tallow for bullets given to Sikh soldiers !! And they did not use pig
        tallow in bullets meant for Pathan soldiers of present day North West
        Pakistan area !! Those bullets all had buffalo tallow. Apparently, EIC
        did not want to displease all at the same time. So why would EIC want
        to convert Indian soldiers? The (paid?) historians and (paid?)
        economists all tell us that EIC came only for business and started
        ruling for protecting business, but had no interest in spreading
        religion.<br />

        So the (paid?) historians and (paid?) economist all tell us that EIC
        never promoted conversions. But EIC did promote conversions thru and
        thru. <br />
        <strong>Why?</strong> <br />
        Because if a soldier gets detached from local religion and community,
        he can be more effectively used to suppress the locals.
        <br />
        Also, EIC wanted to convince its own British soldiers that EIC is
        serious about spreading Christianity, so that religious minded soldiers
        get an additional motivation. <br />
        There are 10s of factors why spreading Christianity was profitable to
        EIC and is also profitable to existing MNCs and US Military. I will
        discuss this in a separate post. But anyway, it was clear that EIC was
        before using buffalo tallow and later it started using cow tallow and
        pig tallow so that soldiers get excommunicated and it becomes easy to
        convert. <br />
        So next question that came to my mind was – why did historians such as
        Romilla Thapar did not write that in my 8th class history textbook?
        This didn&apos;t occur to them? It was too obvious to miss. It took me
        15 years to guess, because I was not spending 8 hours a day on history
        and did not have access to many original records which they had. <br />
        They simply had too much information with them. <br />
        They could not have missed the fact that use of cow tallow and pig
        tallow was intentional and had a purpose <br />
        So why didn&apos;t Romilla Thapar and other historians wrote in the
        textbook that
        <strong
          >EIC wanted to spread Christianity and with that purpose, EIC used
          cow tallow and pig tallow</strong
        >?<br />
        So in around 1995, I started suspecting that historians were paid not
        to write about the motives of EIC. But explanation needed some
        detailing. After all, EIC owners were all dead long back and they could
        not have paid historians. <br />
        Also, if anyone paid,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>how exactly did they pay?</li>
        <li>Did they pay Rs X per fact they would hide?</li>
        <li>And what is historians tell truth after taking Rs X.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        After long fact gathering, I concluded that following was the mechanism
        used to “pay” historians<br />
        The British had significant control over India even after they left.
        Major industrial houses such as Tata, Birla, Sarabhai, Bajaj etc
        depended on British for spare parts of the machines. Not giving them
        spare parts would have meant end of their factories. Some media houses
        were still under control of British. And may be, British had
        information, pictures or other material which using which blackmail of
        Indian leaders would have been possible. Further, if Subhash Chandra
        Bose was alive and in British or Russian custody, then British could
        have blackmailed Jawaharlal Ghazi by telling “obey us, or else we will
        send Subhash Chandra Bose to India ; then he will become PM, and you
        will be nowhere”. <br />In Other Words, British had many levers over
        Indian industrialists and Jawaharlal Ghazi to control them. So under
        British pressure, Jawaharlal Ghazi told elite historians to write
        history that would hide intentions of EIC in spreading Christianity in
        India and keep Indians in dark about intentions of British to impose
        Christianity in India.<br />
        The way Jawaharlal Ghazi told elite historians is “see, if you
        historians write pro-British or less anti-British history, you will get
        promotions, foreign trips etc and if you write too much anti-British
        history, then you may even be expelled and harassed”.<br />
        Also, the History bodies in UK\USA could have promised good ratings,
        foreign trips, allowances, project grants etc if historians were to
        hide reasons by using cow and pig tallow, and not give any funding
        etc<br />
        if historians tell students on motives of EIC in using cow/ping tallow.
        Back in 1950s till .1990s, foreign trip was a big incentive.<br />
        So some historians such as Romilla Thapar sold out and got promoted,
        and those who did sell out not got kicked out and their works did not
        reach textbooks. And the “successful” historians. deleted the facts
        that EIC had pig tallow and cow tallow for conversion purpose. And
        thus, 8th class history textbook did not have the line that
        <strong
          >“British had used pig tallow and cow tallow to impose Christianity
          on Indian soldiers”</strong
        >. IOW, these historians were “paid historians”, <br />just as we have
        “paid journalists”, “paid editors”, paid judges” etc. The payments
        these historians got for hiding the truth were : Positions, fame Power
        to recruit people – translates into cash and many nefarious benefits
        Grants to write books tens of other grants running into crores of
        rupees Foreign tours To get positions/payments, the history textbook
        writers “tailor” the history-textbooks that would please those
        in-charge of deciding promotions and grants.<br />
        The list of facts history textbook writers have been hiding and
        downplaying is long.<br />
        One example is that
        <strong
          >all history textbooks in India refer to 1946 Nary Revolt as Navy
          Mutiny</strong
        >. Mutiny is lowly and derogatory word, while Revolt is a respectable
        word.<br />
        If it was a mere Mutiny and not a Revolt, then why did British got so
        scared and left? In any case, the British did not want word “Revolt” to
        be used for Navy Revolt and instead wanted it to be referred as Mutiny.
        And so all paid historian refer it as Navy Mutiny and not as Navy
        Revolt.<br />
        Likewise, all history textbook writers in India refuse to write the
        fact that British started serious discussion on independence only after
        Navy Revolt in 1946, and ask students to compare and contrast
        importance of Congress and Mohanbhai vs contribution of Mahatma
        Subhashchandra Bose.<br />
        The list of facts historians deliberately downplay or outrightly refuse
        to write is long, and will mention in some other article. But suffices
        to say that just like “all mediamen are paid news”. “all historians are
        paid historians”.

      <hr />

      <h2>Solution to the problem of paid historians.</h2>
      <p>Broadly, I divide historians into two parts ---</p>
      <ul>
        <li>those who are 100% privately funded and</li>
        <li>
          those who thrive substantially on Govt funds and Govt made laws
          and regulations
        </li>
      </ul>
      .
      <p>
        The Govt paid historians not get salaries and grants, but their work
        becomes part of textbooks, which students are required to read, memorize
        and write in the exams and their textbooks&apos; printing is also
        subsidized by Govt. So while their salary and grants may be few lakhs,
        but the money spent in subsidizing their publication runs in crores and
        the fact that students are made/forced to read their writing ensures
        audience of crores and crores readers.<br />
        With Govt support, getting such audience would have cost crores of
        rupees of marketing cost. <br />Which Gazette Notification drafts will
        reduce the possibilities that Govt-paid historians do not sell out to
        private interests such as British or Ministers or anyone? <br />The
        Gazette Notification drafts I propose is Divide Indian History Council
        into 5 independent Councils, with Right to Recall on each of its
        Chairman Let each State have its own History Council or two History
        Council with recallable Chairman The History Textbook Officer for each
        State will be recallable, and Central Govt will not have any textbook
        officer.<br />
        The students in Central Board will study history books from the state
        in which they are and exams will be taken that by that State only. Jury
        System over Staff in History Councils Grand Jury in History Council,
        and any Historians in History Council can publish an article with
        permission of Chairman or permission of Grand Jury in case Chairman
        denies permission.<br />
        These steps will decrease the sell-outs in historians.<br />
        How? If citizens come to know that a Chairman has deliberately hidden
        an important fact, then they will not spare him. The RTR procedures
        will ensure that Chairman do not dare to hide important facts that
        comes to notice. <br />
        <br />Further, an internal Grand Jury System and Jury System will
        ensure that if an employee in History Council is hell bent on exposing
        some facts, the Chairman will not be able to stop him. Further,
        competition between History Chairmen will reduce the benefits they may
        derive by hiding facts. Because a person-A who wants some historical
        facts to remain hidden will pay chairman-B1 who is in-charge of airing
        that fact, only if it is guaranteed that chairman -B2, chairman -B3,
        chairman-B4 and chairman-B5 will also hide those facts. For this, he
        will need to pay all chairmen. <br />
        Further, the JurySys and Grand Jury System will create independence for
        all Historians in the council. So those who want to suppress facts will
        now need to pay too large number of individuals. In such large sample,
        there will be always a small number of individuals who refuse to sell
        out, and so the truth will make its way. <br />
        So above GN will reduce the possibility of history being “paid-history”
        <br />Why did economist hid information on regressiveness of taxes? In
        the next article, I will explain why economics textbook writers hid the
        information about regressiveness factor wrt taxation i.e. the economics
        textbook writers never even BA students that inheritance and wealth tax
        are less regressive than income tax, which is less regressive than
        sales tax or VAT or entertainment tax. <br />
        The main reason was --- they were “paid” not to write about it. All
        this in next article on paid economists. Paid media sponsors
        (Rocofeller, Rothschild, Ambani, Adani, Jindal, Tata etc) are making
        money illegally from mineral loot every year is almost equal to the
        addition of money collected from all types of tax year round by central
        and state governments!!! . <br />
        Central government and state governments collect about 60 lakh crores
        through all types of taxes. And India has about 60 lakh crore mining
        every year. <br />About 15% to 20% of this is deposited by the
        government as royalty etc and the remaining around 50 lakh crore never
        comes on record. <br />
        In other words, the equal amount of budget amount of all the
        governments of India is being looted every year through minerals !! .
        <br />
        Money return passbook law (mineral profit distribution) will stop the
        loot of minerals. . The profits from mining will be deposited in the
        "Joint Account of 135 crore citizens" after the money return passbook
        comes into the law gadget and will be distributed directly to the
        citizens of India every month. <br />
        This amount will be received by each citizen per month will be about
        2500 to 3500 rupees !!. <br />

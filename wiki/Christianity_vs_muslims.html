<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>One question i have faced is&nbsp;: both catholics and Islam had gathering. Then also, from 700 ad to 1200 ad, Muslims kings were winning most battles while Christian kings were losing. Christian kings got completely defeated in eastern holy roman empire. And in Europe, they lost Portugal, Spain , Greece and even upto Hungary.
</p><p>.
</p><p>It was only after after 1200ad, and morE after 1500 ad, christian kings started winning.
</p><p>.
</p><p>So Q I face is&nbsp;: why even though both had gathering procedure, strength difference was so wide?
</p><p>.
</p><p>Imo ( imo), it was because gatherings' head ie village peiest in Christianity by 200 ad came under Pope. This was done by elitemen and kings. Pope vis hierarchy or sometimes directly, appoint or expel priest. So priest has to be more loyal to apex heads.
</p><p>.
</p><p>Whereas maulvi in Islam is appointed by local elders. King or Khali have control over maulvies, but they cannot expel or appoint or transfer. So maulives remain loyal to community
</p><p>Now many 'courts' were back then run by priest or maulvies. Across world, the existing dominant manufacturers will try to use courts ie priests or maulvies to stop newcomers, using numerous rules or judgments. In centralized system like Popeism , they will be more successful. But where maulvies are appointed by local elders, they will be less successful. And so newcomers have better chances to grow. And so industry will improve.
</p><p>Now jurysys which started in Britain in 950ad created far better courts. So by 1050ad, Britain was making more progress in technology and manufacturing. And by 1200 ad , its weapons were superior than rest of the world. So Christian kings started winning and by 1600ad, Islamic kings were no match against them

<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>if facts are useful, then how come 'history' aka 'past facts' is useless?
</p><p>history is lot less than past facts and lot more than past facts. 
</p><p>History is sentences written by present day or some past historians., of whom over 99% were all bikau. And they write on basis of archive which was written by "journalists" of past and based on some leftover of collapsed buildings aka "remains"
</p><p>So archive writers of past wrote loads and lies and deleting many many facts, based on who gave how much money 
</p><p>and modern day historians read them, and then they delete many sentences depending on who pays how much . 
</p><p>So iven if one assumes that present day historians are facthiders, but dont lie, then also we have 
</p><p>history = past facts * fact hiding by p;ast archive makers * lies thrown by past archive writers * fact hiding by today's historians&nbsp;!!! 
</p><p>.
</p><p>So history is lot less than facts and many lies added 
</p><p>Instead, its better to study administration of today across world
</p><p>( aside&nbsp;: events witnessed by all those alive or those whom you personally spoke to is PRESENT and NOT history. Thats will be about 100 years )

<div class="mw-content-ltr mw-parser-output" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hindus accept rss loot becuz of wrong or (imo) right fear that cong aap will support islamic terror. Solution I propose&nbsp;: referendum on guns for all commons via KoorgLawReferendum. 
.
Poor Hindus are leaving Hinduism and imo its due to loot unleashed by rss cong aap etc
.
But middle class Hindus support rss because they fear that cong aap will help muslim criminals. And imo, cong aap will help muslim criminals.
.
Muslims vote for cong aap because they fear that rss will help hindu criminals.
.
So solution I propose is referendum in each district whether they want koorg gun law or not in their district. My vote for ahmedabad district will be YES. And have narcotests in public on all violent crimes.
.
Once all have guns, no one will fear from criminals. And nacrotests will further reduce criminals' guts
.
And an imp co solutions are preferential voting system and longer campaign duration ( usa doesn't have preferential voting system . usa has long campaign duration of 8 months).
.
So Hindus will not need to put up with loot of rss = bjp. And Muslims need not put up with loot of cong aap
